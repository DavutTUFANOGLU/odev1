<h1> DT ARCHITECTECTS</h1>
<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>DT Architects is an İstanbul based, independent architectural studio founded in 2015 by Davut Tufanoğlu.</p>
<p>The studio continues its practice at the offices in Düzce,İstanbul and Iraq Duhok with projects that range from high rise buildings with complex requirements to small villas covering just hundred square meters.</p>
<p>We believe that architecture is an indispensable factor for a livable, sustainable and ecological living space in the globalizing world. With this belief, we design new living spaces.
    We envision a future that criticizes cities and urbanization with honest and ethical designs,
    and looks at social responsibility and education like an architect. We aim to be the leading company that describes the function of life at the individual and social level.</p>
